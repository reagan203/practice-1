    <p>Helicopters, often referred to as "choppers" or "whirlybirds," are remarkable aircraft that have revolutionized the way we think about aviation. Unlike traditional fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters have the unique ability to hover, take off and land vertically, and perform a wide range of agile maneuvers. Their distinctive design, with one or more horizontal rotor blades on top, allows them to generate lift and thrust in any direction.</p>
    <p>The concept of a helicopter is deeply rooted in the pursuit of vertical flight, dating back to visionary inventors and engineers like Leonardo da Vinci. However, it wasn't until the 20th century that practical helicopters were developed and became an integral part of modern aviation.</p>
    <p>Helicopters serve a myriad of vital roles, from military and medical transport to search and rescue missions, firefighting, law enforcement, and commercial air travel. They are well-suited for tasks that require precision, versatility, and access to remote or congested areas.</p>

    <h2 id="about">ABOUT</h2>
    <P>A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by horizontally spinning rotors. This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward and laterally. These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of short take-off and landing (STOL) or short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft cannot perform without a runway.</P>
    <p>In 1942, the Sikorsky R-4 became the first helicopter to reach full-scale production.[1][2]

        Although most earlier designs used more than one main rotor, the configuration of a single main rotor accompanied by a vertical anti-torque tail rotor (i.e. unicopter, not to be confused with the single-blade monocopter) has become the most common helicopter configuration. However, twin-main rotor helicopters (bicopters), in either tandem or transverse rotors configurations, are sometimes in use due to their greater payload capacity than the monorotor design, and coaxial-rotor, tiltrotor, and compound helicopters are also all flying today. Quadrotor helicopters (quadcopters) were pioneered as early as 1907 in France, and along with other types of multicopters, have been developed mainly for specialized applications such as drones.</p><br>
